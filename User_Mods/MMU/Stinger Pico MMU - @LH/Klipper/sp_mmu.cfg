###_______________  LH STINGER PICO MMU  _____________________

### Documentation: https://github.com/lhndo/LH-Stinger/wiki/Pico-MMU



### 1. Config: Add [include sp_mmu.cfg] to your printer.cfg after all your other macros. Note: It renames the base RESUME macro
###
### 2. Slicer: Add: _SP_PRINT_START LANE=[initial_tool] TEMP=[nozzle_temperature_initial_layer] to your slicer's start G-code before the PRINT_START macro 
###
### 3. Macros: Add: _SP_PRINT_END to your slicer's start G-code after the PRINT_END macro.
###
### 4. Slicer: Zero out any Multimaterial settings from Printer, and Filament profiles. Enable Prime Tower in the Printing preset  
###
### 5. Remove any large filament end retract moves such as end_retract or pre_loading from your macros. It's fine to retract <1mm at the end not to ooze over the print.
### 
### 6. Set up your configuration and variables below


### Macros:
### - Use the dropdown arrow on the macro buttons for parameters
 
### - SP_HOME macro homes the unit, frees the filament and turns the servo and the motor off
### - SP_TEST_SERVO macro allows you to manually move the angle of the cam shaft to find the point where it engages with maximum force for each lane. Keep an eye it transitions smoothly between lanes and doesn't get stuck.  
### - SP_TEST_MMU macro tests each lane is succession by moving the filament in an out for a tiny bit. Good for testing the mechanical operation of the unit stand alone
### - SP_FORCE_MOVE_LANE lets you manually move the filament inside a lane. It is handy for calibrating distances, or for manually doing move commands
### - SP_LOAD_HUB and SP_UNLOAD_HUB loads and unloads a lane to and from the HUB
###      If no filament is in the hub triggering the sensor when running SP_LOAD_HUB, then the macro can park the filament precisely inside the hub.
###      If you want to unload a lane and a filament is present in the hub, then use SP_UNLOAD_HUB FORCE=1 
### - SP_LOAD_EXTRUDER and SP_UNLOAD_EXTRUDER lets you load or test the filament operations between the HUB and the extruder
### - SP_TEST_LOAD_UNLOAD_EXTRUDER does both of the operations above in succession
### - SP_LOAD_HOTEND and SP_UNLOAD_HOTEND loads and unloads the filament previously parked in the coldzone. It automatically heads the hotend if needed
### - SP_LOAD_LANE and SP_UNLOAD_LANE loads the filament from the HUB to the nozzle, chaining LOAD EXTRUDER and LOAD HOTEND and doing some error checks in between
### - SP_FILAMENT_CHANGE replicates the entire unloading and loading procedure that is usually encountered during print time
 
### - SP_FORCE_SET_LOADED_LANE and SP_FORCE_SET_HOTEND_LOADED macros set the current physical state of the machine for the code to recall in case you loaded the filament manually into the extruder or into the hotend
### - SP_CLEAR_ERROR_CODES clears the internal error variable used by the chained commands to track the success of the previous execution
### - SP_SET_ANGLE_OFFSET is a temporary solution to set an angle offset to the cam selector in case things go wrong or drift during a print  
### - SP_INIT initializes the MMU, clears the variables, homes and turns off the unit
