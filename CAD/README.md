## CAD

The project was built in Fusion 360, and those files are preferred as the primary choice for consulting the assembly.  
They are packed into f3z files, which maintain links/instances to all components and sub-assemblies. This way it is easier to make modifications by third parties and keep track of the changes for future integration.  
It is advised to create a folder inside your Fusion workspace in which to import the f3z.

STEP files are provided for compatibility with other CAD software.
